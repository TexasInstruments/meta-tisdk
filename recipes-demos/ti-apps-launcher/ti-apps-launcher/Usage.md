# TI Apps Launcher: Camera: User Guide

- The Camera app allows you to Record videos from connected cameras in either
 H264 or H265 formats. The recorded videos are named based on the time of
 recording and has codec name within the filename for easy identification.

- The recorded files are stored in `/opt/ti-apps-launcher/gallery/`.

- The Camera app also allows you to play these or any other custom h264 or h265 
 videos which are in either .h264/.h265/.mp4 format. The codec info must be
 available in the file name for it to be displayed in the gallery dropdown.
    Ex: sample_video.h264, sample_video_h265.mp4, etc.
